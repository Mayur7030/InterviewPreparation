Event bubbling and event capturing –
*   When elements receive events, such events propagate to their parents and ancestors upward in the DOM tree.
•	Event capturing means propagation of event is done from parent elements to child element in the DOM 
*    event bubbling means propagation is done from child element to parent elements in the DOM.
•	The event capturing happens before event bubbling.
•	If {capture: true} ,event capturing will occur else event bubbling will occur.
•	Both can be prevented by using the stopPropagation() method.


Event capturing -->






code------------------------->
document.getElementById('body').addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log("body is clicked")
})
div.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log("div is click")
})
span.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log("span is click")
})
button.addEventListener('click',(e)=>{
    e.stopPropagation()
    console.log("button is click"),
})
// output
// button is click
// span is click
// div is click
// body is clicked
