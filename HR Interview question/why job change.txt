Why do you want to change jobs?



I'm currently working as a frontend developer at TCS, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that I've had here. However, I'm feeling ready for a new challenge. I'm eager to take on more responsibility and to work on more complex projects. I'm also interested in working in a more fast-paced and innovative environment .
