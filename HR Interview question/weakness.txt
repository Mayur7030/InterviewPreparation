One thing I'm working on is being too much of a perfectionist. Sometimes, I spend more time than needed on tasks to make sure they're perfect. I've realized it's important to balance perfection with efficiency. So, I'm learning to manage my time better and use tools that help me work faster without sacrificing quality. I believe this will make me a more effective developer."
