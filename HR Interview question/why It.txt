1.	Why you choose iT job?

Although studying mechanical engineering in college, I have always had an interest in computer science and coding. In my final year of college, during the pandemic, I took a few computer science courses, some of which were in web development. I got fascinated with this field and decided to switch to it, which is why I joined TCS. After joining TCs, I joined a web development project where I had the opportunity to gain expertise in web development.
