1.	Why you choose iT job?



I've always been interested in computer science and coding, even though I studied mechanical engineering in college. I took a few computer science courses in college, and I also taught myself to code in my free time. I've always enjoyed the problem-solving and creative aspects of coding, and I'm excited to use my skills to build user-facing interfaces.
