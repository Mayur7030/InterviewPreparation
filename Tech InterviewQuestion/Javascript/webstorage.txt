local storage
session storage

localStorage: localStorage is a way to store data on the clientâ€™s computer. It allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5. However, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to erase all localStorage data.

SessionStorage: stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed.

cookie: Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side .
