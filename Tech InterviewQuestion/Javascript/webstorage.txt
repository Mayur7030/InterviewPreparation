local storage
session storage


Both localStorage and sessionStorage are web storage options in browsers. The main difference is that localStorage persists even after the browser is closed, while sessionStorage is cleared when the session ends (when the browser is closed).


// Storing data
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({ name: 'John', age: 25 }));

// Retrieving data
const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));

// Removing data
localStorage.removeItem('theme');

// Clearing all data
localStorage.clear();
