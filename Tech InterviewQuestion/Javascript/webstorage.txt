local storage
session storage

localStorage: localStorage is a way to store data on the clientâ€™s computer. It allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5. However, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to erase all localStorage data.

SessionStorage: stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed.

cookie: Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side .

cache-
A cache is a hardware or software component that stores data in order to serve future requests more quickly. Caching is a common technique used in computing to improve performance by storing frequently accessed or computed data in a location where it can be quickly retrieved, rather than recalculating or fetching the data from its original source.

Here are a few types of caching commonly used in computing:

Web Browser Cache:
cdn cache-


// Storing data
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({ name: 'John', age: 25 }));
JSON.stringify-
The JavaScript object or value to be converted to a JSON string.

// Retrieving data
const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));

JSON.parse-
 Parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript object or value described by the string.
// Removing data
localStorage.removeItem('theme');

// Clearing all data
localStorage.clear();
