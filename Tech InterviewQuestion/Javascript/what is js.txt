JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for web development.JavaScript is commonly used to create dynamic content, handle events, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and interact with servers through asynchronous requests.

Js is lightweight, crossplatform, singlethreaded and interpreted programming language.



Interpreted Languages:

Code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime.
More portable, as source code can run on any system with the interpreter.
Better support for debugging at runtime.
Examples: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP.
Compiled Languages:

Code is translated into machine code or bytecode by a compiler before execution.
Generally offers better performance.
May be less portable as compiled code is platform-specific.
Debugging can be more challenging.
Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust.
