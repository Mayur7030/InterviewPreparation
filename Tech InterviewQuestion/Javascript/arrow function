features of arrow function -


1)Concise Syntax:

2)Implicit Return:

Arrow functions automatically return the result of the expression without the need for an explicit return statement if the function body is a single statement. This can make the code more readable and reduce the number of lines.


3)No Binding of this:

Arrow functions do not bind their own this value. Instead, they inherit the this value from the enclosing scope. This behavior is often desirable, especially in callback functions or when working with object methods.


4)Shorter Syntax for Single-Parameter Functions:

If an arrow function takes only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter list, further reducing visual clutter.

5)No arguments Object:

Arrow functions do not have their own arguments object. Instead, they inherit the arguments object from the enclosing scope. This can be advantageous in certain situations.
