In JavaScript, generators are a special type of function that can be paused and resumed. They are defined using a function* declaration or by using the function* expression. The main feature of generators is their ability to yield values one at a time, allowing the calling code to control the iteration manually.

Generators use the yield keyword to produce a value and pause the execution of the generator function. When the generator is called again, it resumes execution from where it was paused, retaining its internal state.

function* myGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

// Using the generator
const gen = myGenerator();
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
console.log(gen.next().value); // 3
console.log(gen.next().value); // undefined


In this example, each call to gen.next() returns an object with a value property representing the yielded value. The generator function produces values in a sequential manner, and calling next() resumes the function until the next yield statement.
