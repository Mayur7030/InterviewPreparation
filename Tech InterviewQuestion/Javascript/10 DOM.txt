DOM stands for ‘Document Object Model’. In simple terms, it is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web app. DOM represents the entire UI of your application. The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. It contains a node for each UI element present in the web document. It is very useful as it allows web developers to modify content through JavaScript.

BOM --

The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a term used to describe the set of objects provided by web browsers to interact with and control the browser itself. It represents a collection of objects that expose the functionality of the browser window, allowing developers to manipulate the browser's behavior, handle events, and retrieve information about the browser and the device.

window.alert("Hello, World!"); // Display an alert in the browser window
document.getElementById("myElement"); // Get an element by its ID
console.log(navigator.userAgent); // Get the user agent string
window.history.back(); // Go back one page in the browser history
console.log(window.location.href); // Get the current URL
console.log(window.screen.width); // Get the screen width
