HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. They provide information about the status of the request and indicate whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action. Here is an overview of some common HTTP status codes:

1xx - Informational:

100 Continue: The server has received the initial part of the request, and the client should continue with the remainder of the request.
2xx - Success:

200 OK: The request was successful. This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests.
201 Created: The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request, but there is no content to send in the response.
3xx - Redirection:

301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
302 Found (or Moved Temporarily): The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.
304 Not Modified: Indicates that the client's cached copy is up-to-date, and the requested resource has not been modified since the last request.
4xx - Client Errors:

400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to malformed syntax or other client-side error.
401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication. The client must provide valid credentials to access the requested resource.
403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource.
5xx - Server Errors:

500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
501 Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
502 Bad Gateway: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.
