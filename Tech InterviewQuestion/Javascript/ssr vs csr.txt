Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

In Server-Side Rendering, the server generates the full HTML content and sends it to the client as part of the initial response. The client receives a fully rendered HTML page, which can be displayed immediately. Subsequent interactions with the page may involve additional requests to the server for dynamic content or updates, but the initial rendering is done on the server.

Advantages of SSR:

Improved SEO: Search engines can crawl the fully rendered HTML content, improving search engine optimization.
Faster Initial Page Load: Users receive a fully rendered page, which can be faster to load and display.

Client-Side Rendering (CSR):

In Client-Side Rendering, the initial HTML sent by the server is minimal, often just containing the structure and references to JavaScript and CSS files. The client's browser then takes over the rendering process. The JavaScript code is executed, and it fetches data, manipulates the DOM, and renders the content dynamically on the client side.

Advantages of CSR:

Enhanced Interactivity: Allows for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Reduced Server Load: The server is not responsible for rendering the full HTML on every request.
