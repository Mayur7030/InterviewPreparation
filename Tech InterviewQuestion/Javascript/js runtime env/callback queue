The callback queue is a part of the event-driven architecture in JavaScript, and it plays a crucial role in handling asynchronous operations. To understand the callback queue, let's break down the concepts in detail:

1. Asynchronous Operations:
JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one operation at a time in a sequence. However, there are tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server or reading a file, that would block the execution if done synchronously.

2. Callbacks:
To handle asynchronous tasks, JavaScript uses callbacks. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is intended to be executed after the completion of a particular task.

3. Callback Queue:
When an asynchronous operation completes, its corresponding callback function is not immediately executed. Instead, it is placed in a queue, known as the callback queue.
The callback queue is a data structure that holds these functions until the execution stack is empty.

4. Execution Stack and Event Loop:
The execution stack is a stack data structure that keeps track of the functions being executed. When the stack is empty, the event loop checks the callback queue.

5. Event Loop:
The event loop continuously checks the callback queue while the execution stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it takes the first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the stack for execution.
