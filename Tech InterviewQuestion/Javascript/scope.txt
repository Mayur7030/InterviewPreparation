"scope" refers to the context in which variables and functions are declared and accessed. The scope determines the visibility and lifetime of these entities.

•	Local Scope/functional scope - allows access to everything within the boundaries (inside the box)

•	Global Scope is everything outside the boundaries (outside the box). A global scope can not access a variable defined in the local scope because it is enclosed from the outer world, except if you return it.


•	Block Scope is everything inside the boundaries but it works only for let and const keywords. It does not work with the var keyword. 
{
    let a = 99
}
console.log(a)           
// a is not defined
