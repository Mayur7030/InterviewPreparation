New -- Axios –js library to make http(hypertext transfer protocol)request from browser to web server

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript. It is a popular library used to make HTTP requests from the browser and the server. 


Here are some of the features of Axios:

•	Promise-based: Axios uses promises to handle the asynchronous nature of HTTP requests. This makes it easy to chain requests together and handle errors.

Automatic JSON Data Transformation:
Axios automatically transforms JSON data, making it convenient for sending and receiving JSON payloads.

Request and Response Interceptors:
Interceptors allow you to run your code or modify requests and responses globally before they are sent or after they are received.

•	Configurable: Axios is highly configurable. You can customize the headers, timeouts, and other settings of each request.
•	Lightweight: Axios is a lightweight library that is easy to download and install.
•	Cross-platform: Axios can be used in the browser and the server.
