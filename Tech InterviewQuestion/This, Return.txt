Return  
The return statement is a useful tool for controlling the flow of execution of a JavaScript function. It can be used to stop the execution of a function early, to return a value from a function, and to avoid errors. The return statement in JavaScript is used to return a value from a function. The function will stop executing when the return statement is called and the value will be returned to the caller of the function
