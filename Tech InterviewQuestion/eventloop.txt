The event loop is a crucial part of JavaScript's concurrency model, allowing it to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. Let's walk through the event loop process step by step with an example:

step 1 )Global Execution Context:

When your JavaScript code is executed, a global execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack.
step 2) Execution of Synchronous Code:

The engine starts executing the synchronous code line by line, pushing functions onto the call stack and executing them.

 code ----------------->
console.log("Start");

function syncFunction() {
  console.log("Sync function");
}

syncFunction();

console.log("End");

//Output:

Copy code
Start
Sync function
End

step 3) Asynchronous Operation Encounter:

When an asynchronous operation, such as a setTimeout function, is encountered, it is moved to the Web APIs environment. The Web APIs environment includes the browser's APIs like setTimeout, fetch, and others.

 code----------->
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout function");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
//Output:

Start
End
Timeout function


step 4) Callback Queue and Event Loop:

After the timer in setTimeout expires, the callback function is pushed into the callback queue.


step 5) Event Loop Checks the Call Stack:

The event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack.

step 6) Execution of Asynchronous Code:

The callback function from the callback queue is executed.


//Output:

Start
End
Timeout function


Here's a more complex example involving both a microtask (Promise) and a macrotask (setTimeout):

code -------------->
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout function");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise resolved");
});

console.log("End");


//Output:

Start
End
Promise resolved
Timeout function


In this example, the microtask queue (Promise) has higher priority than the callback queue (setTimeout). Therefore, the Promise is resolved first before the setTimeout callback is executed.

Understanding the event loop is crucial for writing efficient and responsive asynchronous JavaScript code.
