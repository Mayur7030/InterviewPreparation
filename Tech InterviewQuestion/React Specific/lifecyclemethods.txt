React  components have a lifecycle consisting of three phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Each phase has specific lifecycle methods that are called at different points in the component's lifecycle.

Understanding these lifecycle methods can help developers to control the component's behavior and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.

The Mounting Phase begins when a component is first created and inserted into the DOM. T
he Updating Phase occurs when a component's state or props change. 
the Unmounting Phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM.



Mounting:

constructor(): Initializes state and binds methods.
getDerivedStateFromProps(): Updates state based on props before rendering.
render(): Generates the component's visual representation.
componentDidMount(): Runs after mounting, for tasks like data fetching or setting up timers.



Updating:

getDerivedStateFromProps(): Updates state based on props before re-rendering.
shouldComponentUpdate(): Determines if a re-render is needed.
render(): Generates the updated UI.
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): Captures info before the UI changes.
componentDidUpdate(): Runs after updating, for tasks like DOM manipulation.


Unmounting:

componentWillUnmount(): Runs before removing the component from the DOM, for cleanup.


code----

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritefood: "rice"};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({favoritefood: "pizza"})
    }, 1000)
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    return {favoritefood: props.favfod };
  }
   render() {
    return (
      <h1>My Favorite Food is {this.state.favoritefood}</h1>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<Header />, document.getElementById('root')); 



related hooks in funcitonal component ---

Mounting:

constructor(): useState for initializing state and useEffect with an empty dependency array for tasks that should run only once after mounting.
getDerivedStateFromProps(): useEffect with props in the dependency array to update state based on props changes.
render(): This method exists in functional components as well.
componentDidMount(): useEffect for tasks that need to happen after mounting, like data fetching or setting up timers.


Updating:

getDerivedStateFromProps(): useEffect with props in the dependency array, as mentioned above.
shouldComponentUpdate(): React.memo for optimizing re-renders by shallow comparison of props.
render(): This method exists in functional components as well.
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): useEffect with a callback function as its second argument to capture information before update.
componentDidUpdate(): useEffect with a dependency array that includes props or state values that trigger update-related actions.


Unmounting:

componentWillUnmount(): useEffect for cleanup tasks, returning a function that will run when the component unmounts.
