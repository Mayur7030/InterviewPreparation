Pagination in React refers to the practice of dividing a large set of data into smaller, manageable chunks or pages, allowing users to navigate through the data one page at a time. This is commonly used when dealing with lists or tables of data that are too large to display all at once. Pagination improves user experience by presenting a subset of data on each page and providing controls to move between pages.

In a React application, pagination is typically implemented using a combination of state management, component rendering, and event handling.
