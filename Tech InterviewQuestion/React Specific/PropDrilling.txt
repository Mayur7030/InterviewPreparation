Prop drilling, also known as "props drilling" or "component chaining," is a situation in React where data is passed down through multiple layers of components as props, even when some intermediary components do not need that data. This can make the code more complex, reduce code maintainability, and make it harder to understand and debug.

Drawbacks of Prop Drilling:

Readability and Maintainability:
Code Verbosity:
Refactoring Challenges:
Debugging
 Complexity:

5 ways to avoid prop drilling-
1)context API
2)Redux
3)component Composition
4)callback function
5)custom hooks
