Optimization of react –

Optimization of React is the process of making a React application run faster and more efficiently. There are many ways to optimize a React application, some of which are more effective than others.


Here are some of the most common ways to optimize React applications:

•	Use lazy loading:
 Lazy loading is a technique in web development that defers the loading of non-essential resources until they are actually needed. In React, lazy loading is often used for code-splitting, allowing you to load components or modules on demand, which can significantly improve the initial loading time of your application.

code-------------->
// LazyComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const LazyComponent = () => {
  return <div>This is a lazily-loaded component!</div>;
};

export default LazyComponent;


// App.js
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

•	Use memoization: Memoization is a technique that caches the results of expensive calculations. This can improve the performance of your application by preventing the same calculation from being performed multiple times.

useMemo() , useCallback(),  react.memo
----------------------------------------------------
*  Use Proper Keys for Lists:
Ensure each item in a list has a unique and stable key to optimize rendering.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Use code splitting: 
Code splitting is a technique that divides your application code into smaller chunks that can be loaded independently. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be loaded initially.

code -----------
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [view, setView] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Dynamically import the component based on the selected view
    const loadView = async () => {
      if (view === 'home') {
        const Home = (await import('./Home')).default;
        setView(<Home />);
      } else if (view === 'dashboard') {
        const Dashboard = (await import('./Dashboard')).default;
        setView(<Dashboard />);
      }
    };

    loadView();
  }, [view]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setView('home')}>Load Home</button>
      <button onClick={() => setView('dashboard')}>Load Dashboard</button>
      {view}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;


In this example, the code for Home and Dashboard components is loaded dynamically only when the respective buttons are clicked. This way, the initial bundle remains small, and components are loaded on demand.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

•	Use functional components: 
Functional components are a newer type of React component that are more efficient than class components. This is because functional components do not have a state or lifecycle, which can improve the performance of your application.
-------------------------------------

•	Use performance tools:
 There are a number of performance tools available that can help you identify and fix performance problems in your React application. These tools can help you to optimize your application for different devices and browsers.
react dev tools

--------------------------------------------

•	Use a content delivery network (CDN):
 A CDN is a network of servers that can be used to deliver static content, such as images and JavaScript files, to users. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the distance that content needs to travel to reach users.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* use Types
using static typing with tools like Typescript can help catch errors early, improve code quality and provide better documentation for your component's expected data and props.
------------------------------
*use helper/utils
helper or utility functions can encapsulate ,common ,reusable logic in your code application making your compoenent cleaner and more focused ontheir core functionlity

//helper.js
export function formatName(fname,lname){
  return `${fname}${lname`}
}

//compoenent.js
import {formatName} from './helper.js'
const fullname = formatName("mayur","pawar")
