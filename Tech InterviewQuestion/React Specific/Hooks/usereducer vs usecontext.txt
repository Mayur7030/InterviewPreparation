useContext Hook:

Purpose: Used for accessing the value of a React context.
Typical Use Case: When you have a global state or some values that need to be shared across components without prop drilling.


useReducer Hook:

Purpose: Used for managing complex state logic in a more predictable and centralized way.
Typical Use Case: When the state transitions depend on the previous state or when there are multiple sub-values in the state.

In summary, useContext is primarily for accessing values from a context, while useReducer is for managing state transitions, especially in scenarios involving complex state logic
