code splitting is a technique to split the javascript bundle into smaller chunks which are loaded on demand.

3 steps for code splitting
use React.lazy() to lazily import components
wrap components with Suspense to handle loading
configure your build tool (eg webpack)for dynamic imports

pros -
1)faster initial load time
2)optimized bandwidth usage
3)improved caching- 
4)parallel loading-multiple small chunk
5)easier maintainance

cons-
1)increased complexity
2)toolling dependencies
3)potential for runtime error
4)increased number of request
5) learning curve
