8 step process -

Client-side Authentication:
User sends username and password to the server.
Server-side Authentication:
Server authenticates the user credentials.
Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) containing information about the user and signs it with a secret key.
Sending JWT to Client:
The server sends the JWT token to the client as a response.
Storing JWT Locally:
The client stores the JWT token securely in local storage or a cookie for future use.
Requesting Data with JWT:
Whenever the client needs to access protected resources on the server, it includes the JWT token in the request headers.
Server-side Validation:
Upon receiving the request, the server verifies the JWT token's signature and authenticity using the secret key.
Data Retrieval:
If the token is valid, the server processes the request and returns the requested data.
Displaying Data:
The client receives the data from the server and displays it in the browser.
