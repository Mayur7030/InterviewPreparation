Node.js and Express.js serve different purposes in the context of web development, but they are often used together. 

Node.js:

JavaScript Runtime:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome.

Core Functionality:
Node.js provides the core functionality for handling I/O operations, such as reading and writing files, making network requests, and interacting with databases.

Event-Driven and Asynchronous:
Node.js is event-driven and asynchronous, allowing it to handle many concurrent connections without blocking the execution of code. This is achieved through the event loop.

Low-Level:
Node.js is relatively low-level and doesn't come with built-in features for handling web applications, routing, or middleware.


Express.js:

Web Application Framework:
Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. It provides a higher-level set of abstractions for building web and mobile applications.

Routing and Middleware:
Express.js simplifies the process of defining routes, handling HTTP methods, and managing middleware. It offers a more structured way to build web applications.

HTTP Utility Methods:
Express.js provides utility methods for common HTTP operations, such as setting headers, sending responses, and handling errors.

Templating Engines:
Express.js can be integrated with various templating engines (like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars) to dynamically generate HTML pages based on data.

Higher-Level Abstractions:
Express.js abstracts away many of the lower-level complexities of Node.js, making it easier for developers to build scalable and efficient web applications.
