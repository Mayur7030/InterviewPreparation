oop -
for different things we will not code seperately 
like in GTA ,we will not code differently for different  humans ,
we will create Human(class) then make different objects from them( police,male, female,children)
which having same METHODS( run, walk) and different properties(color, height)

4 piller of Oop -
1 ) inheritance - properties from parent 
2 ) abstraction - secure the data
3) polymorphism - one thing different format - like phone -camera, recorder 
4) encapsulation -4 things in one
